# discordbot1
A basic Discord bot I tried to make a few months ago. Had the connecting and basic text based commands working fine, but I hit a
lot of roadblocks trying to setup music streaming from other websites like many popular Discord bots have. I felt like I was a 
little over my head, so I settled for playing the audio from local files, once that was working I decided to retire the project 
until a further date when I feel like I can work past the previous issues.
